This app is a front end for a BI / Data mining project.
The application involves 3 tabs :
* The first one contains the predictions for the number of sales during the coming days.
* The second tab offers replacement for medicament tapped ( in case they don't exist in the inventory)
* And the third one is a result of apriori algorithm to see what drugs are sold together.
